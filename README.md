This project was done for TheOdinProject here (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).

Days taken: 7
Time taken: 15 hours

This project is a simple flight booking application intended to practice creating nested forms.  Due to the understanding I developed from the last project (LINK HERE) this project wasn't quite as hard as the last one.  The most difficult part of this project for me was once again correctly setting up my database.  Initially I had the associations set backwards, so my Bookings model couldn't create multiple passengers.  After solving this problem and refactoring the relevant code, the project really came together.

From this project I was able to practice making class methods, scopes, and instance methods in my models and to practice making nested forms.
